2018-08-13, v.0.7.0
    1. A major syntax change in "Edit row" dialog: the values from the dialog are put
       in an update/insert SQL statement "as is", so the user has control over value types
       (e.g. 50 versus '50').
    2. Fix: forcibly update the panel after executing "lua <lua_code>" from the command line.
    3. Prevent updating the panel in cases it is not needed:
       Shift-F5 (conditionally), Shift-F6 (always), F8 (conditionally), Shift-F8 (always).

2018-07-26, v.0.6.0
    1. Edit/insert table row dialog does not close on errors - it gives an opportunity
       to fix the error and try again.

       - "sql <text>" will execute an SQL query <text>.
       - "lua <text>" will execute a Lua code <text>.

    4. Added function polygon.debug().
