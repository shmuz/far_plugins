          the same as for command line calls (but the prefix is not needed).
          New switch -a for asynchronous calls.
      [+] Function MakeResident: parameter can be a table. That makes

          (They can be added via files _usermenu.lua).
      [*] The plugin's DLL, as supplied, now embeds scripts and modules in
