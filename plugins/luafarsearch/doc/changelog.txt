  [!] Panels (Rename): in some cases the field "Before" displayed its text partially (or not at all),
                       due to incorrectly calculated LeftPos in Far Manager.
                       This fix is similar to one in v3.40.3.
  [!] A fix in macros\lfsearch.lua ("Jump from Grep results").

  [+] Self-test operates with all available regexp libraries.


2010-07-25, v2.0.1
  [!] plugin didn't work installed on a non-ASCII path, due to using
      plain Lua variants of (require, loadfile, io).
  [+] PCRE: \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W work with Unicode characters
      (PCRE 8.10 required).

  [+] First Unicode version.
  [*] Far 2.0 + LuaFAR 2.3 are required.
  [+] User-selectable regular expression library

2009-12-24, v0.9
  [*] LuaFAR 1.0 is required (was: >= 0.8).
  [*] PCRE built with no recursion: slower but safer.
  [*] Empty search pattern is not accepted: error message is displayed.
  [*] Pressing Enter on the dialog containing an invalid field value
      will display error message without closing the dialog.
  [!] Replace pattern, sequences of the kind \xhh :
      -- They were affected by the text case modifiers, such as \u or \L.
      -- They are still affected by encoding conversions (DOS to Win, etc.)
         but that appears too hard to fix.
         [*] For that reason, only values \xhh <= \x7F are allowed.
  [!] Replace pattern:
      \x25 was treated as an empty string rather than the percent sign.
  [+] The plugin's menu made expandable: user scripts can be added.
      API for access to the plugin internals is provided. This allows
      to implement presets, automatic operations and other interesting things.
  [+] Self-test added, as a user script.
  [*] Line Filter: made function (was: expression).
  [!] "Repeat" operation under Far 2: search/replace patterns were picked
      from the registry without the required codepage conversion.


2009-11-23, v0.8
  [*] PCRE built with no UTF-8 support, as the plugin currently
      does not support UTF-8 search. (This removed 95 KiB from the DLL).
  [!] Eliminated excessive screen flickering during repetitive replace.
  [!] Accommodated to the changed dialog history format introduced
      in Far 2.0.1208 (the correct format is determined at run time).
  [+] Russian help file added.
  [*] In 'Function Mode' and in 'Line Filter', the preset variable for
      the regex library is "rex" (was: "lib").


2009-11-12, v0.7
  [!] \E in replace pattern was treated as $E
  [*] PCRE ver. 8.00 is embedded (was: ver. 7.8)
  [*] Lua and LuaFAR libraries are not embedded

  [!] "wrap around" mode: "$" pattern was found twice on the initial line;
  [*] "repeat" mode: use search and replace patterns from FAR history.
      If either of them was changed by other programs, then "repeat search"
      is performed, even when the last plugin operation was "replace";
  [*] show found matches vertically centered on the screen;
  [*] "show all" mode: show the first match on the line as selected text;
  [*] scope in replace operation is determined by the user (was: automatic);
  [+] checkbox "Replace in selection" on Replace dialog;


2009-02-06, v0.3
  [!] "wrap around" mode: a word couldn't be found if the cursor was
      positioned in the middle of that word;
  [*] better handling of syntax errors in Search and Replace dialogs;
  [+] operation and button "Show All";
  [+] operation and button "Count";
