    1. Lua API: remove function polygon.debug; remove table polygon.
    2. When entering a table with > 20000 rows, sort mode is forcibly switched to "unsorted"

       are placed in item.UserData verbatim.

2018-08-13, v.0.7.0
    1. A major syntax change in "Edit row" dialog: the values from the dialog are put
       in an update/insert SQL statement "as is", so the user has control over value types
       (e.g. 50 versus '50').
    2. Fix: forcibly update the panel after executing "lua <lua_code>" from the command line.
    3. Prevent updating the panel in cases it is not needed:
